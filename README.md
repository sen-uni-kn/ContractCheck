# ContractCheck

(This is only a prototype and the tool and this manual is still on construction.)

## Installation
First, install the contained JobScheduler libraries jars with Maven.
Second, Maven can compile and run the ContractCheck source code.

## Run

The Web Interface can be started by running the class LegalTechWebEditor as a java application.
Before you can start the web interface add a private key in a file keystore.p12 to the legaltech.webeditor/srv/main/resources folder.

The single contract is analyzed by running the class Test_MainLegalCheck.
